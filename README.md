The purpose of this project is to create an abritrage sports betting program that identifies arbitrage opportunities determines the how much to bet on each of the outcmoes to gaurantee profit.

The program currrently: 
- identifies arbitrage opportunities in real time using a sports betting API
- displays results of arbitrage opportunites as well as how much to bet for each team along with their expected profit    

This notebook is split into two sections: 
- **Functions**: the definition and explanations of functions.
- **Main**: the section where you can actually run the program to search for arbitrage opportunities.  

You can customise in the "Main" section:
- the database you wish to pull from
- the amount of money you wish to visualise the arbitrage for 
- whether or not you want the arbitrage results of all matches (yes and no) or just the ones that have arbitrage opportunites (yes only)  
- whether or not you want the results of only matches that have not become a live game yet (pre-game period)
